# Notes:
This project establishes a number of routes to: 
1)create 2)Read 3)Update 4)Delete user and course records withing the provided database.
It also has authenticating and validation requirement.

there are two middlewares in this project in the folder middleware.
# 1-async-handler:
  to make codes shorter and cleaner I have separated asyncHandler function into a separated file and it got imported in the needed places such as routes.
# 2-auth-user:
  also for authenticateUser done the same to make the codes much more readable.

# To Test the app:
make sure running npm install and then npm start.

there are no renders for this project , you can test the different routes in "POSTMAN" software by importing "RESTAPI.postman_collection" file in the postman and just choosing different provided routes and clicking send to see the results which are reading ,creating , editing and deleting.

thank you TreeHouse for another challenging project.
